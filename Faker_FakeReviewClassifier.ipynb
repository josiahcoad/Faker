    "  It has become a common practice for online reviews to have a major impact on the decision of the potential customers of that product. Positive reviews can result in significant financial gains. This gives a strong incentive for fraud reviews, also commonly called opinion scamming. Opinion scamming includes fake blogs, reviews, deceptive advertising and more. Our research is accordingly focusing on product reviews based on the Amazon dataset from Professor Caverlee’s lab at Texas A&M University. Reports indicated 2-6% reviews on average are fake with up to 20% on sites such as Yelp. This leads to an unrealistic representation of places and products on the internet. Additionally, there are some fake review cases in the news for example [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "  Based on existing machine learnign techniques, we applied unsupervised clustering and observe that whether the spam/fake reviewers can be clustered together. In order to enhance the performance of learning process, we preprocessed the data to focus on suspicious group or individual because we believe that the some obivious features are similar within these groups.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The key difficulty in determining fake reviews is that it is extremely hard for humans to identify fake reviews. In one related work, it was said to take a team of industry experts eight weeks to develop a labeled data set. We believe that a machine can do better at identifying the fake reviews by extracting the implicit information or behavior feature inside the reviews efficiently.\n",

    "\n",
    "To initialize tha data before classifying, we categorized them into groups of members because people who write fake reviews will appear some similar behavior so that this can be a clue that we find them out through group. Afterwards, we explore eight different features on each group and utilize them in the vector space. Now that we have the vector of each group, we implement scaling and normalization to find out the top k, scores of being fake reviewer. Eventually, we feed our input space to Self-Oorganising map(SOM) machine and further observe the result of clustering, and compare the results with  different approaches such as word2vec and basic cosine similarity.\n",

    "### 2.1 Group Indicator\n",
    "\n",
    "By grouping our reviewers together in hand tune features of rule-base design, hoping to get a better result of detecting fake review. Here we defined the rules of grouping: (1) If a member rates a certain product with ONE or FIVE stars, he/she is eligible for group. (2) If eligible members commonly rate on the same three or more products, we will form them a group. Note that one member can be in different groups. For example, member A, B, C, and D rate on the same three products i, j, and k as five stars. Therefore, they will form a group. Furthermore, member A, B and C rate products i, j, k, and l as five stars, they will form another group. The condition of rules has the hueristic meaning because one that rate extreme scors may be attempting to make impact on certain product, and if all the members in a group commonly rate on certains product, they has higher probabilities to be conspiracy. By applying these rules, we obtain 1307 different groups and 82577 products that has been rated over once. The related codework is shown on two cells below.\n",

    "### Self-Organizing Map\n",
    "A Self-Organizing Map, also called Kohonen Map, is a type of neural network which maps points from an input space to points in an output space. This transformation keeps the topology of the data by using a set of neurons in the same feature space fitted to the dataset so that the final topology of the neural network is a good representation of the data. By doing so, points that were close in the input space will also be close in the output space.\n",
    "For an input data point in the high-dimensional feature space, the corresponding output will be the neuron in the feature space which is the closest to this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/fig_1.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "A self-organizing map consists of components called nodes or neurons. Associated with each node are a weight vector of the same dimension as the input data vectors, and a position in the map space. At first, we assign the weights of the neurons be initialized to small random value. Than, the neuron whose weight vector is most similar to the random sampling input is called the best matching unit(BMU). The weights of the BMU and neurons close to it in the SOM lattice are adjusted towards the input vector. During mapping, there will be one single winning neuron: the neuron whose weight vector lies closest to the input vector. This can be simply determined by calculating the Euclidean distance between input vector and weight vector. By the same time, we also up date the neighbors that fulfill neurons cooperation that near-by neurons on the lattice get a chance to adapt.\n",
    "Our updating weight function is $$\\vec{w}_j :: \\vec{w}_j + \\eta h(j,i(x))(\\vec{x}-\\vec{w}_j) $$ where $$i(x) = argmin_j|\\vec{x}-\\vec{w}_j|$$\n",
    "The figures below show examples of SOM structures with an input layer in a 6-dimensional feature space (on the left) and two possible network topologies (on the right). The only connections shown are between the input vector and one output neuron, but each dimension of the input layer is actually connected to every node.\n",

    "#### Median Interneuron Distance(MID) matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of SOM is to perform dimensionality reduction. However, if our data can be mapped to a 1 or 2-dimensional network as previously described, we now have to visualize this network. This can be done by computing the median interneuron distance matrix. For a 2-dimensional grid network of $MxN$ neurons, each value of the $MxN$ matrix is the median of the Euclidean distance between a neuron $w_{i,j}$ and the neurons in its neighborhood, with $1 ≤ i ≤ M$ and $1 ≤ j ≤ N$. After normalization, we obtain a weight matrix that can be plotted in 2D space. Each value of this matrix corresponds to a neuron in the network, and values close to 1 show neurons far from their neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the SOM is trained and the MID matrix computed, outliers can be detected. This detection starts by identifying outlying neurons, which are neurons lying far from the other neurons and could have been attracted by dense sets of outliers such as in figure (on the left) below. If such neurons exist, they can be easily identified using the MID matrix. As we can see in figure (on the right) below, outlying neurons have a value in the MID matrix much higher than the one of the other neurons. We can thus use a simple threshold or compare those distances to do our selection. The plot of the MID matrix is a good tool to check the existence of outlying neurons. When this is done, outliers are the data points having for winning node an outlying neuron.\n",

    "The figures below show the training of the SOM. We have used a 2-dimensional grid of size 10x10, each step updates the value of the winning node and its neighborhood. 400 000 iterations (equivalent to 20 times the size of the dataset) were used with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and an initial standard deviation for the neighborhood of $\\sigma = 1$. The 2D representation of the neural network has been computed by the multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm implemented in scikit-learn.\n",

    "\n",
    "SOM is a very good algorithm for fraud detection. It identifies data points that are not consistent with their neighbourhood. Frauds are identified by the fact that the data points corresponding to them are outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that SOM can also work well in identifying fake online reviewers. This is because fake reviewers do not behave like normal reviewers and the data points corresponding to them are very different from the data points corresponding to normal reviewers. This problem is just like the fraud detection problem and hence a SOM would be good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to the SOM is a feature vector that contains the group features extracted from the groups and the group ID appended at the beginning of the vector. The SOM returns the map of winning neurons i.e. the weights of the neurons. The winning neurons and the median distance of the neighboring data points are projected into the MID matrix. A threshold value of 0.8 is set and elements with MID values greater than the threshold are flagged as fake reviewer groups. The reviewers belonging to the fake groups are the fake reviewers.\n",
    "A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional, discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map. In our case, after the exprirement, we decided to set our map into 2D. This dimensionality reduction makes SOMs useful for visualizing low-dimensional views of high-dimensional data. Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent, and in the sense that SOM use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space. \n"

Policosanol seems to decrease cholesterol production in the liver and to increase the break down of LDL (low-density lipoprotein or \"bad\") cholesterol. It also decreases the stickiness of particles in the blood known as platelets, which might help reduce blood clots. The next ingredient is Guggul which is made from the sap (gum resin) of the Commiphora mukul tree, which is native to India. This tree has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries.Guggul contains substances that lower cholesterol and triglycerides. One of these substances also decreases the redness and swelling that occurs in some types of acne. OK.. so you get to lower your cholesterol and have clear skin! Another main ingredient is cayenne pepper. Cayenne has been shown to reduce plaques in the blood vessels. It does this by helping break up the fibrin networks that hold the plaques in place. It also reduces the formation of blood clots, which keeps blood flowing freely through the arteries and veins. I would say for all the health benefits in this pill I HIGHLY recommend it.

Another awesome feature of this style of insulation is there is no condensation on the mug with iced beverages.

What I didn't know before was Buriti Fruit Oil is a heavy hitting, antioxidant rich oil (virtually odorless) and is great for problematic skin. I have a skin condition called keratosis pilaris, also known as k.p. A lot of people actually have k.p. and just don't realize it. It is synonymous with rough and bumpy skin, most of which is found on the backs of your arms. These bumps are caused by an excess of keratin buildup which surrounds the hair follicle. Dry skin only exasperates the condition. This fruit oil helps keep the skin fresh and moisturized. With a dedicated routine of proper exfoliation and a good moisturizing oil, such as this one, it is possible to help keep these skin bumps at bay. Hurray! You can add a tiny amount of Buriti Fruit Oil to any existing OTC skin lotion (provided it's not medicated) and create your own skin super cocktail. I just use it straight from the bottle ala carte. I apply 4-6 drops per arm and rub it in well until it disappears into the skin. Buriti Fruit Oil comes from the fruit of a palm tree that grows in the swampy areas of South America, primarily Brazil. The locals there have been using the pulp from the Buriti Fruit for ages, as both topical remedies, beauty infusions, and as a dietary staple. I was fortunate to receive this purchase at a discount for the purpose of testing and review. I have never been asked to give a positive review in return, only an account of my experience using the product and my opinion on its quality and value.

There are 2 settings one is a contentious feed (red light) and the other is a 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off (green light), both will automatically shut off.  When I'm talking about the 2 different lights I'm talking about the on/power light, not the whole system different colored lights.  The whole system power lights are amazing, depending on what mood you feel like you have a very wide assortments of colors, blues, greens, purples, pinks, reds, peach, clear etc.  The motor itself is a little loud not bad but louder than others I have used.  I do like that you can hear the water flowing a little bit, it's very soothing.  You can adjust the mist direction by turning the whole system or by putting the top cover on in the direction you want the flow to go.  Personally I have them in opposite directions at night, I have the main light off, but the mini power/on light either green or red I have pointing in the other direction so I can't see it and the flow blowing towards me.

There are a lot of companies that claim to sell 100% jojoba oil and I fell for one of them. It failed all of the purity test I could find. It was Majestic Pure\\'s jojoba oil. Before I put any oil, in any of my skin care products or hair, I test them to make sure the product is what it claims to be. After my husband purchased MJP\\'s jojoba oil for me I tested it on a small patch of skin, put it in the back of my refrigerator and kept it there for a week straight, then a month and it never solidified. If you know jojoba oil (which is actually a liquid wax) you know the real stuff will solidify in cool temperatures between 44-50 degrees Fahrenheit. The oil I received from MJP remained mostly liquid with small lumps inside. Those tiny lumps were the jojoba oil. It was heavily diluted and I was extremely disgusted. I also developed a rash on that small patch of skin. I never put that oil anywhere else on my hair or skin after that. I couldn\\'t trust whatever substance they put in that bottle. The jojoba oil I received from Radha Beauty (that came in a pretty dark blue bottle) passed that test. I put it in the fridge yesterday around 7:00pm and when I took it out this morning at around 10:00 it was completely solid. Radha\\'s jojoba oil has the golden color that is one of the characteristics of pure undiluted jojoba oil. Diluted jojoba oil loses that golden characteristic and becomes colorless. The oil I received from MJP was almost completely clear. I\\'ve noticed that companies that sell diluted jojoba oil (which again is actually a liquid wax) will say that they have filtered out the waxy esters to make it better for your skin but in doing that, if it\\'s even possible, they would actually be taking away most of the oils beneficial properties. Those waxy esters mimic sebum which is what makes it so good for your skin. So if you see those words in any product description for jojoba oil, it\\'s very likely that it\\'s diluted. The word pure on a product or in a product description doesn\\'t really mean much lately because you really cannot trust the ingredients that some companies use.  Just take a closer look at the ingredients on some of their labels and you\\'ll notice many chemical additives that makes it far from anything that can be considered pure. This is one of the few companies whose \"pure\" claim I actually trust. Real jojoba oil is very versatile and has many different uses. It can be used in hair as a moisturizer, a pre shampoo treatment, a treatment for split ends. It can be used to treat acne. It can used on both wet and dry skin since it\\'s easily absorbed for added moisture without leaving skin greasy. It can be used for diaper rash with your pediatricians approval. It\\'s antibacterial properties even make it excellent to use to treat mold, that was surprising. I have used this oil as a facial moisturizer (after it melted which took less than 30 minutes even in my air conditioned home) and rubbed a very little bit between my hands and through my hair. I also put a dropper full in 1/4 cup of coconut oil and used that as a pre shampoo treatment since both oils have the ability to penetrate hair follicles. As a result, my face has not resembled a grease pot all day and still feels soft and moisturized hours later. And my hair feels soft, silky and moisturized without feeling greasy or weighed down. This oil does not have a strong or long lasting scent. It is absolutely amazing. You get a large bottle for a relatively low price. The bottle I received was filled almost completely to the top. It was so full, that it spilled from the top when I put the dropper half way into the pretty dark blue bottle. Amazon has a large quantity of jojoba oil vendors, this is one (Radha) of the three I found that sells the real deal that I trust. You can conduct the test yourself. Just put the oil in your fridge and wait. It takes less than 30 minutes for the oil to melt at room temperature so you really have nothing to lose. It\\'s well worth a try because it\\'s so versatile. I absolutely love this stuff!

So when I seen this product, I was excited to give it a try. I purchased this product mainly to help me with the skin discoloration. This is my second time purchasing this product.  At first, I was a little skeptical about it working. The bottle seemed to be a little generic. I can say that the past few weeks that I have been using it, I have notice a significant change with the my skin discoloration. Even thought most products states that it takes 30 days to notice change in your skin, this product works within the first few days of consistent use. Because i wear foundation during the day time, I use this as a part of my night time regimen. I put a few drops on my hands (a little goes a long way) and rub on my face in a circular motion. I have not experienced any reactions since using this.  What I do love about this product,, is it allows me to not  have to use my acne regiment (steroid creams prescribed by my dermatologist) on a daily basis. I can say this definately has lighten up some areas of my skin.. It also keeps my skin bright, hydrated  and  feeling/looking smooth.  I did notice this change after using for a few days. Another thing i like about this serum, is that it is not excessively oily/greasy and there is not a strong chemical/perfume smell to it.  I strongly suggest giving this a try.

I ground it again a bit longer and added two tablespoons of grounds to eight ounces of water boiling water. It produced a slightly darker cup of coffee but still not quite what it should be. At this point I was frustrated because I spend about $25-30 on my bags of coffee beans and the waste was irritating. I was so close to just using my cappuccino machine and calling it a day. I then googled coarse grounds to see how they should look and grounded up some beans one last time. I added four tablespoons of coffee to the pot and poured the water inside following the directions. Finally it looked like coffee, smelled like coffee and tasted divine. I have been using this machine for several days now with perfect results each time. I have also used it to brew my loose leaf green tea,\\\\xa0chai tea, lavender tea, and black tea. It made a fantastic cup of tea and I didn't end up spitting out missed leaves or flowers every few seconds. I'm absolutely in love. This French press pot is stylish and modern and it adds a very nice touch to my kitchen. It eventually became very easy for me to use and I now get a perfect cup of coffee and tea every time. I plan to use some of the leftovers from those first grounds for iced coffee. This pot would even make an excellent cup of espresso since you can completely control the water temperature and brewing time so you won't end up with a burnt tasting bitter cup of one of the best things ever made. It is very easy to clean and sturdy enough that I don't fear it breaking after each use. Overall I really love this pot and I give it 5 solid stars and would definitely recommend it.

When planting the seeds or small plants you can use it to dig holes or trenches and the handy measurements along the blade make it quite simple to know how deep to dig and how to space the plants.  The blade's measurements go up to 6 or 150 mm, but the entire tool is a foot long so you can use the handle as well to space out your plants that need more room. Once your plants are growing the serrated blade works quite well to cut vines or even the larger produce like zucchinis off the vine.  My only complaint with the blade is it is quite difficult to cut produce in half as the blade is rounded.  This design is great for digging holes and trenches, but makes it quite combersome to cut a head of cabbage in half.  I suppose most gardeners do not need to split their produce in the garden, but we do in our community garden. The blade does not go through the entire handle, but instead is 2 into the handle.  The blade is quite thick and so I do not see an issue of it ever breaking or coming lose from the handle. One thing I must point out is the wooden handle.  Even though I am a woman, I have quite long fingers and larger hands.  The handle is squared off and not rounded and for me personally it does not fit as comfortably in my hand as I would like.  My husband on the other hand loves how it felt in his hands and the other men at the community garden didn't have an issue either. The knife also comes with a holder you can wear on your belt so you always will have it when needed. One thing I noticed is the holder allows the knife to slide easily into it.  It is not too snug and thus the serrated edges never touch the side and will not slowly destroy the holder.  The holder has an eyelet for hanging the tool when not in use. This is fast becoming my favorite gardening tool and I would recommend anyone who has a large garden to get one. Pros: Stainless steel blade so it won't rust Wenge wood handle which can handle getting wet Measurements (both inches and mm) for placing plants/seeds in proper depth and distance apart Knife also can be used to dig Serrated knife perfect for cutting vines and produce Comes with holder you can wear on your belt or hang up in the tool shed Cons: Handle is square and doesn't fit as comfortably in my hand as I would like Hard to cut produce in half due to the rounded knife I was given this knife for free in exchange for my opinion and review.\", 'memberId': 'A2FTAUIK8OPUEY', 'productId': 'B00YNSB34W'}, {'Rate': 5, 'reviewId': 'RJX9AQ24GBWDS', 'video': '0', 'verifiedPurchase': 'false', 'reviewTitle': 'A Drying Mat Which I Know Is Clean', 'Date': '1473449244', 'reviewText': \"I hate hand washing dishes.  I personally put everything I can in our dishwasher, but there are a few items I have to hand wash and let dry on my counter.  A few years ago I purchased a microfiber drying mat, which is great until it started to stink.  I always allowed the mat to air dry between uses and washed it weekly, but after months of use it began to smell and of course I can't bleach it because it has a color.  I did find a product which took the smell out, but it will return again if I don't use the product on it weekly.  So I was intrigued when I was given the opportunity to try this silicone mat.The mat is raised throughout so the water can drip off the dishes and into the channels.  Once the dishes are dry I pick up the mat, drain the accumulated water off into the sink and then lean it up against the back of the counter so it can dry.  No more smelly drying mat.  Plus, if it does get nasty or gunky (which I know it will as I will be using this for years and years), I can take a brush to it and wash it down.  The manufacturer said it can be placed in the washing machine.  I am not sure I ever will do that, but it's an option.I love this mat for one reason: I know if it is clean or not by looking at it.  My microfiber mat obviously wasn't clean or it wouldn't smell, but it looked clean.  This mat, I can scrub with a brush, wash with vinegar or even spray with a bleach solution (yes, I know don't mix vinegar and bleach.)Pros:Allows water to drip off the dishesThe dishes are lifted off the surface of the mat so the interiors can air dry &#8211; no more wet interiorsCan be cleaned easily - I would highly recommend always lifting the mat to air dryCushioned surface so fragile dishes will not break when placed upon itCan be rolled up and stored in a drawer if neededCan be used as a trivet for hot pots and pansCan be hung to dry on a small hookCons:Some people may want a larger mat (I like the size, but then I don't do much hand washing)I was given the drying mat for free in exchange for my opinion and review.\", 'memberId': 'A2FTAUIK8OPUEY', 'productId': 'B01JHIJAY2'}, {'Rate': 5, 'reviewId': 'R1LAPJQJ78E2QV', 'video': '0', 'verifiedPurchase': 'false', 'reviewTitle': 'No More Messy Toddler at Mealtime', 'Date': '1475261599', 'reviewText': 'I have four children and never once used a bib which had a pocket because I thought they were too hard and would be uncomfortable to wear.

    "The output of the SOM gives the reviewer IDs that are fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, by looking at the dataset we had assumed that a few reveiwers were definitely fake reviwers based on the content of their reviews. But, surprisingly the results we obtained were pretty different. Those reviewer IDs were not returned by the SOM as fake ones. This might be due to the fact that it is very difficult to distinguish fake reviewers from normal ones by just observing the content of their reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grouping reviewers using the criteria that we chose helped us identify reviewer patterns which helped us understand the beahavior of fake reviewers better. This also helped us catch fake reviewers who were difficult to identify by from just the content of their reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "The SOM at times gives different output every time it is run. This is because the weights of the neurons are initialized randomly every time it is run. This is an issue with SOM and the variance can be minimized by letting the SOM run for a large number of iterations. Typically, the number of iterations should be 20 times the size of the dataset. In our dataset the number of groups is about 5000. Hence, we have run the SOM for 100,000 iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, SOM does find fake reviewers but it is pretty unpredictable. We chose SOM as our clustering algorithm because it is great at detecting frauds and is used in detecting credit card frauds. The problem we had was pretty similar but in this case we had to put reviewers into groups and design their feature vectors. Although we had hoped that SOM would work very well to solve our problem but it seems that it requires a lot of dataset, iterations and parameter tuning to detect fake reviewers and reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also trained KMeans algorithm using reviewer centric features (individual reviewers). The results with K-Means were consistent and did not change as it changed with SOM with different iteration.\n"

    "Prior works on opinion spam focused on detecting fake reviews and individual fake reviewers. However, a fake reviewer group (a group of reviewers who work collaboratively to write fake reviews) is even more damaging as they can take total control of the sentiment on the target product due to its size. Therefore, we are going to follow our base paper trying to identify fake reviews by clustering fake spammers into groups, which are also called group spammers[1]. Group spamming refers to a group of reviewers writing fake reviews together to promote or to demote some target products. The base paper[1] we choose has done experiments that show it is hard to detect spammer groups using review content features or even indicators for detecting abnormal behaviors of individual spammers because a group has more manpower to post reviews and thus, each member may no longer appear to behave abnormally. A group of reviewers refers to a set of reviewer-ids. The actual reviewers behind the ids could be a single person with multiple ids (sockpuppet), multiple persons, or a combination of both.\n",

    "Therefore, we will also implement a relation-based model “GSRank” described in [2] using an Artificial Neural Network [5] as the following figure1. The GS rank algorithm is an unsupervised iterative algorithm that works differently from the traditional supervised learning approach to spam detection. The paper [2] has concluded after experiments that “GSRank” performs better than the state-of-the-art supervised classification, regression, and learning to rank algorithms. Basically, we also follow this paper [2] to build a more effective model which can consider the inter-relationship among products, groups, and group members in computing group spamicity. In other words, we will try to reimplement the paper from scratch. In conclusion, after getting two different result as we mentioned above, we will evaluate with Precision, Recall and NDCG.\n",
