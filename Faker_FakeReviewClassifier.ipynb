    "  It has become a common practice for online reviews to have a major impact on the decision of the potential customers of that product. Positive reviews can result in significant financial gains. This gives a strong incentive for fraud reviews, also commonly called opinion scamming. Opinion scamming includes fake blogs, reviews, deceptive advertising and more. Our research is accordingly focusing on product reviews based on the Amazon dataset both from University of Illinois at Chicago[1] and Professor Caverlee’s lab at Texas A&M University. Reports indicated 2-6% reviews on average are fake with up to 20% on sites such as Yelp. This leads to an unrealistic representation of places and products on the internet. Additionally, there are some fake review cases in the news for example [6].\n",

    "  Based on existing machine learnign techniques, we applied unsupervised clustering and observe that whether the spam/fake reviewers can be clustered together. In order to enhance the performance of learning process, we preprocessed the data to focus on suspicious group or individual because we believe that the some obivious features are similar within these groups.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The key difficulty in determining fake reviews is that it is extremely hard for humans to identify fake reviews. In one related work, it was said to take a team of industry experts eight weeks to develop a labeled data set. We believe that a machine can do better at identifying the fake reviews by extracting the implicit information or behavior feature inside the reviews efficiently.\n",

    "Prior works on opinion spam focused on detecting fake reviews and individual fake reviewers. However, a fake reviewer group (a group of reviewers who work collaboratively to write fake reviews) is even more damaging as they can take total control of the sentiment on the target product due to its size. Therefore, we are going to follow our base paper trying to identify fake reviews by clustering fake spammers into groups, which are also called group spammers[1]. Group spamming refers to a group of reviewers writing fake reviews together to promote or to demote some target products. The base paper[1] we choose has done experiments that show it is hard to detect spammer groups using review content features or even indicators for detecting abnormal behaviors of individual spammers because a group has more manpower to post reviews and thus, each member may no longer appear to behave abnormally. A group of reviewers refers to a set of reviewer-ids. The actual reviewers behind the ids could be a single person with multiple ids (sockpuppet), multiple persons, or a combination of both.\n",

    "Therefore, we will also implement a relation-based model “GSRank” described in [2] using an Artificial Neural Network [5] as the following figure1. The GS rank algorithm is an unsupervised iterative algorithm that works differently from the traditional supervised learning approach to spam detection. The paper [2] has concluded after experiments that “GSRank” performs better than the state-of-the-art supervised classification, regression, and learning to rank algorithms. Basically, we also follow this paper [2] to build a more effective model which can consider the inter-relationship among products, groups, and group members in computing group spamicity. In other words, we will try to reimplement the paper from scratch. In conclusion, after getting two different result as we mentioned above, we will evaluate with Precision, Recall and NDCG.\n",
