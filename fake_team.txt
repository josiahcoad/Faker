I started using them, and initially I didn't see any results, but after maybe a week or so of taking them, I noticed that I hadn't had an issue with an anxiety attack in quite some time. I also noticed that I was feeling more energetic and sleeping much better at night. I waited another month. Whoa. No anxiety attacks.

It is well made, made a fantastic cup of coffee and cleaned out well. Like most french presses it came with a spare filter but it's always a nice addition to any package. I have a keurig, a percolator, a regular drip and have owned in the past just about every kind of coffee maker you can easily come by and this makes a perfectly decent cup of coffee I am sure that if you've used one before you'll be happy with this one. I do find it important to note that it may make three cups, but don't confuse &#34;cups&#34; with mugs. If you are used to the typical coffee cup served in most restaurants, you will be disappointed at the size. Go for the larger size unit instead.
