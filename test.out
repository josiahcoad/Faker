[{'Rate': 4.0, 'reviewText': 'I was already using the Argan Oil Conditioner so when I saw this shampoo I figured I would give it a try. I will say it has a distinct odor-not necessarily bad but very distinct. The conditioner does not have the same smell. And after rinsing, my hair does not retain the odor so it is not really concerning to me. It does not have a very frothy lather but many more natural shampoos do not. We are just so used to having a rich, foamy lather we think it is not working if we dont. I have not been using it long enough to say if it prevents hair loss but I will say my hair has been fuller since I started using it. If I dont put leave-in conditioner in, it is actually TOO full. It is sulfate and paraben free along with being cruelty free. They are listed on the Leaping Bunny site as a legitimate cruelty-free company, which is important to me.

I have lost half of my hair thickness during this time, and wish I'd have found this sooner.

Now I am 40, and so everybody in my family is like, well you're older now it's normal! No. No its not. Clumps of hair coming out in the shower when i wash my hair is not normal. I saw a dermatologist about my hair falling out and she had me collect and count my hairs! Long story short, anything over 100 hairs is not normal. So, needless to say, I am producing DHT. I've just started using the Pura d'or and I have noticed a slight improvement. Prior to this, I was using the no-poo method of just baking soda and a vinegar rinse. I like this product because I missed using shampoo and the great clean feeling you get after using it. I love that this product is organic and all natural with Argan oil. I am a die hard argan oil girl. I know that this is going to take some time to get better. I didn't lose half my hair overnight, so i don't expect to gain it back overnight. I am still alternating my washes with the no-poo method in an effort to conserve this shampoo, cause it is pricey.

It is necessary to leave the lather on your hair for several minutes to get the benefits of the shampoo and hair restoration. The shampoo has no harsh chemicals in the mix and, from my experience, is very gentle on your existing hair.

I have mixed feelings about this shampoo. I received a small 4 oz sample from a friend of mine and it seemed worth trying... Pura d'or Argan shampoo was wonderful for my hair, so I took the plunge.  I was hoping, not for this to magically regrown my hair, but to cleanse the scalp of toxins and chemicals that can clog hair follicles and prevent healthy growth. Where I am wavering on this is the Organic claim, but it actually includes a (very common) toxin... that I was trying to avoid by &#34;quitting&#34; my other shampoos. The scent is a bit off putting, but dissipates quickly after rinsing. If you are dedicated to healthy hair scent is usually a deterrent. I have tried some awful smelling shampoos in the name of health! haha.  It lathers well, and you don't need a lot to wash. What I liked: this left my hair feeling very clean, but not stripped. And soft with less frizz than usual. What I don't like and why I am sticking with an &#34;It's Okay&#34; rating is the toxin added, but the &#34;premium organic&#34; label/listing. Everyone is different and some customers may not mind the addition. Upon some research, it is a common and mild toxin, but a toxin nonetheless. I still love Pura d'or and will continue using their argan shampoo for now.

This aromatherapy device is really easy to use by just filling with water and a few drops of essential oils.

It came with directions I just choose not to use them. I have had no issues with this product, the amount of steam that it kicked out was wonderful!!!

I have been using this for a few days in my room at night with some Peppermint Oil in it as it's sinus issue time for me and so far this has really helped!!  There are 2 settings one is a contentious feed (red light) and the other is a 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off (green light), both will automatically shut off.  When I'm talking about the 2 different lights I'm talking about the on/power light, not the whole system different colored lights.  The whole system power lights are amazing, depending on what mood you feel like you have a very wide assortments of colors, blues, greens, purples, pinks, reds, peach, clear etc.  The motor itself is a little loud not bad but louder than others I have used.  I do like that you can hear the water flowing a little bit, it's very soothing.  You can adjust the mist direction by turning the whole system or by putting the top cover on in the direction you want the flow to go.  Personally I have them in opposite directions at night, I have the main light off, but the mini power/on light either green or red I have pointing in the other direction so I can't see it and the flow blowing towards me.  If I'm not sleeping I turn the spout to mist out towards the center of the room.  The mist goes straight up and doesn't swarm down in a big downward cloud of mist like another one that I have does.I received this item for Free in return for my Honest Review.

This 120 ml Diffuser came in an attractive and informational product box, along with a small water pitcher for filling the Diffuser and the power cord, as well as a helpful little user&#8217;s manual that tells about the product and gives detailed instructions. There is also some basic information on the product box.This Diffuser goes through a series of being lit up seven different colors. You can stop it on any of the colors you prefer, allow it to work its way through the color cycle, or turn the light off, making it perfect for a bedroom, if you like it dark. It can be set to mist for 30 seconds and then stop for 30 seconds or it can be set to mist the whole time. I love that the Diffuser will just shut itself off when the water runs out. This humidifies the room as it diffuses, which can be helpful as well. I use it with my Radha Essential Oils as well as any other Essential Oils I have. I&#8217;ve had my Diffuser for about two weeks now and it works perfectly in our bathroom with no problems. It&#8217;s perfect for a smaller size room, although it does run out of water sooner than my larger size Radha Beauty Diffuser. I really only have room for this size Diffuser in the bathroom. I&#8217;m very happy with this Diffuser and would definitely feel good recommending this or, if you do need a larger one, their 500 ml Diffuser is fabulous as well. This Diffuser puts out a very nice stream of mist, scenting the air very well.', 'video': '0', 'verifiedPurchase': 'false', 'Date': '1475301550', 'productId': 'B014SF6MBI', 'reviewId': 'R1QWSC5KJDGAI4', 'memberId': 'A25Z1JJ2KUWUDA', 'reviewTitle': '~ EXCELLENT Diffuser - The BEST of Its Size. ~'}]

[{'Rate': 5, 'reviewText': "Another great Shampoo from Art Naturals, I'm really impressed with their products.  I am a license Cosmetologist and I would highly recommend this shampoo.  You only need the size of a dime for shoulder length hair for your shp, on your second shampoo you need less.  It's super concentrated so a little goes a long ways.  I'd suggest a dime size for short hair, quarter max for very long thick hair.  Since I've been using this I have noticed that my hair is easier to comb through, I do not need as much conditioner after use of this shp, and my daily hair loss is a lot less.  After I apply my conditioner in my hair I run through with a pick to evenly distribute it through out my hair, the amount of hair on my pick after is a lot less this is how I know I'm losing less ;)  My daughter has longer thicker hair and she noticed the same results as I stated above.I received this item at a Discount in return for my Honest Review.", 'video': '0', 'verifiedPurchase': 'false', 'Date': '1456280709', 'productId': 'B016XANH32', 'reviewId': 'RQBP6PVBY1JME', 'memberId': 'A13SC93G2S92PD', 'reviewTitle': 'Small Amount Goes a Long Ways'}, {'Rate': 5.0, 'reviewText': 'This shampoo boasts all natural ingredients and is designed to prevent hair loss.
